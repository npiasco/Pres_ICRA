\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
	A new method for learning an image descriptor from side modality have been presented. Our descriptor performs especially well for challenging \textbf{cross-season} localization scenario, therefore it can be used to solve long-term place recognition problem. We additionally obtain encouraging results for \textbf{night to day} image retrieval.

	For future works:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item use other modalities,
		\item investigate less trivial descriptor fusion method,
		\item test on other visual localisation tasks (e.g. direct pose regression).
	\end{itemize}
